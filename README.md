Hey curious explorer 👋, welcome.

We are happy to present to you this **NER Open Data repository** on the behalf of 🎈🎆 each unknown generous contributor 🍾🎉.  Feel free to use this in your pet projects, geeky experiments, futuristic products or anywhere your creative mind tells you to. We feel very proud of making our first baby step 👶 to push language barriers together with the public. Let's make sure that no one gets discriminated in the connected world because of their language, at least in India 🇮🇳🇮🇳. And let everyone build tools for anyone else across boundaries.

## Are you are a developer researcher or hobbyist? 💻🔬🏏
We encourage you to make use of this data and let's see what we could give in return.

## Are you an Entrepreneur? 🏢
We have got a great idea and awesome tools, but no data? Don't let data unavailability limit your imagination. Let's pave infrastructure for the future today.

## Are you a student? 💯🎓
You have got a lot of time to learn new stuff and experiment with it. Give this a try and let's see where this leads you. Ask questions on that journey, and we're here to help you smash any roadblocks 🥊🥊.

## And finally.., We need your help as well. 🆘
